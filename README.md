# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Bobby’s manager oin preparing for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. We will conduct a database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees currently working in all departments of the company to be able to develop a plan for recruiting new employees and prepare a mentoring plan.

The criteria are based on birth dates from 1952 to 1955 and recruitment dates from 1985 to 1988.

## Results
- After creating the unique_titles table by joining the Employees and Titles tables, filtering by date of birth and hire date, removing duplicates, and sorting the data points by hire date, 90,398 employees will retire according to the above criteria.
- It was also  found that there are currently a large number of retired employees with senior professional titles (57668), and about 64% of employees are retired. See table of unique titles below.

## Summary

Currently at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their workforce is preparing for retirement, or is in a mentoring program, which means they will likely need an extensive hiring process in the years ahead. With a large proportion of future retirees in senior roles, mentoring programs should provide a capacity buffer for the broad expertise that will leave the company in the coming years.
